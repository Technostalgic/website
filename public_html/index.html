				There's nothing here at all yet so don't get too excited. 
				In the meantime while I'm building the website, feel free to check 
				out my projects on 
				<a href="https://technostalgic.itch.io/">itch.io</a> or 
				<a href="https://github.com/Technostalgic/">github</a>.

			<p class="blockBody"> 
				I spend most all of my free time working to improve my 
				understanding of programming languages and how to put 
				each language to use in such a way that it is being 
				utilized at it's full potential. I have a lot of fun 
				with it and usually end up developing games that I then 
				polish and release on my website, as well as helping out 
				other indie developers by creating small useful libraries 
				for anyone to use, free of charge.
