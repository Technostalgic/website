				<div class="blockBody"> 
					<p>Hello, I'm Isaiah.</p>
					<p>
						I'm originally from Seattle, WA, but have lived all over the US in the 
						past few years: Washington, Oregon, New Hampshire, and now I'm in Colorado.
					</p>
					<p>
						As of 2017 I have been teaching myself about video game development 
						for 7 years, I started during my sophomore year in high school thanks 
						to my good friend at the time 
						<a href="https://whybotherplayinggameswhenyouwilljustdieandforgetthem.itch.io/">Mason</a>, 
						who now as it turns out, is 
						pretty successful with his own development team working on 
						<a href="https://twitter.com/burritogalaxy">Burrito Galaxy 65</a>. 
						He got me into the programming side of development, 
						starting out with Microsoft's (unfortunately) discontinued XNA Framework.
					</p>
					<p>
						After I got comfortable with that, which took me the better part of 
						three or so years, I decided that it was time to step it up, and I 
						competed in the 27th Ludum Dare Competition. All the positive feedback 
						I received just encouraged me to get even more into video game 
						development. I ended up making 
						<a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=23578">Zero Gravity Freerun</a> 
						which ranked 20th in "fun" and 41st over all, which was much better 
						than I ever dreamed of doing.
					</P>
					<p>
						I eventually got my Associate's degree studying computer science, even 
						though it took me four years to complete. All the while I was learning 
						as much as I could about game programming and making all sorts of little 
						knick knacks and test demos. During that time I expanded my code vocabulary 
						from just C# with XNA, to the more basic aspect of C#'s .NET framework and 
						studied a few other interpreted languages such as JavaScript and Python. I 
						also messed around with C++ and SFML for a bit but didn't manage to make any 
						impressive projects with that. The language that I enjoyed the most was 
						JavaScript. Not because of the JavaScript, but because it was ridiculously easy 
						to make simple front-end video games that are accessible to virtually everyone 
						without even having to download an executable.
					</p>
					<p>
						And that's where I am now. Just having fun making HTML5 games and sharing 
						with the world what I've got.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have, however, been secretly working on a MonoGame project under the radar 
						for a while now, that I would describe as my "Dream Game" and I hope to one 
						day release it as a full game.
					</p>
					<p>Enjoy :)</P>
